<h3>Analysing WeRateDogs twitter account</h3>
The project is about wrangling and analysing the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. The data gathered from the account is dirty and messy. So before analysing the result, it will first be assessed, for both quality and tidiness of the original data. The final result is analysed and visualised in act_report.
